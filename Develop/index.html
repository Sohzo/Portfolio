        <h2>About Me<img src="./assets/images/thumbnail_IMG_4203.jpg"></h2>
        <p>My name is Jonathan Winter, and I'm currently enrolled in the University of Utah's Coding Bootcamp. I've grown up using computers, starting at the age of 5. Over the years I've learned many of the intricacies that computers have to offer. In my bootcamp, I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many other useful languages. I hope to be able to do freelance coding work once I'm done, but hopefully even sooner. Outside of coding, I'm extremely active. I've been actively weight training for over 2 years now, and I've recently started MMA fighting about a year ago. Being physically active is an essential part of my life. I also love to learn cooking, as eating healthier is much easier when the food tastes good.</p>
